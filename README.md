# Clustering Project

This project is part of the Data Science course MADS-MMS (Mathematics and Multivariate Statistics).

**Main task:** Conduct an exploratory data analysis on a suitable real-world dataset (sports car prices in this case). The result is a Jupyter Notebook containing comprehensive experiments. The project contains the Jupyter Notebook code and the sports car prices dataset. The reference and license of the dataset are mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Libraries Used:**
1. **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations and array handling.
3. **Matplotlib:** Employed for data visualization and creating plots.
4. **Scikit-Learn:** Employed for machine learning tasks, including clustering algorithms (K-Means, EM), data preprocessing, and feature scaling.

**Skills and Techniques**:
1. **Data Analysis:** Explored and understood the structure of the dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
2. **Data Visualization:** Created various plots and visualizations to interpret and present the results.
3. **Machine Learning:** Applied clustering algorithms (K-Means, EM) for grouping sports cars based on features.
4. **Feature Selection:** Implemented feature selection techniques (VarianceThreshold, Mutual Information) to identify relevant features.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilized PCA for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.
6. **Documentation:** Provided clear and concise explanations for each step of the analysis in Jupyter Notebooks.
7. **Critical Thinking:** Demonstrated critical thinking by interpreting and providing insights based on the analysis results.
8. **Communication Skills:** Effectively communicated the project's purpose, process, and findings.

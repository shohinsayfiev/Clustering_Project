# Clustering Project

This project is part of the Data Science course MADS-MMS (Mathematics and Multivariate Statistics).

**Main task**: Conduct an exploratory data analysis on a suitable real-world dataset (sports car prices in this case). The result is a Jupyter Notebook containing comprehensive experiments. The project contains the Jupyter Notebook code and the sports car prices dataset. The reference and license of the dataset are mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Libraries Used**:
1. Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and array handling.
3. Matplotlib: Employed for data visualization and creating plots.
4. Scikit-Learn (sklearn): Utilized for machine learning, including model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
5. Joblib: Used for model storage and persistence.

**Skills and Techniques**:
1. Data Preprocessing: You demonstrated skills in data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing data for machine learning.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an initial data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
3. Model Selection: Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms to choose the best one for the task.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Performed hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the model's performance.
5. Nested Cross-Validation: Applied advanced cross-validation techniques to robustly assess model performance.
6. Feature Scaling: Standardized features to ensure models perform efficiently.
7. Model Deployment: Created a production-ready model and saved it for future use.
8. Conclusions and Future Work: Summarized project results and provided ideas for future improvements and extensions.
